## Buyback Transparency 🔥

**20% of all paid subscription revenue** automatically goes to meme coin buybacks.

### How It Works
1. **Automatic Allocation**: When you subscribe, 20% of your payment is allocated to buybacks
2. **Scheduled Execution**: Buybacks are executed regularly (daily or weekly)
3. **Full Transparency**: Public dashboard showing:
   - Total buybacks executed
   - Buyback history
   - Next scheduled buyback
   - Token price impact
4. **On-Chain Verification**: All buyback transactions are recorded on-chain for full transparency

### Why This Matters
- **Community Value**: Your subscription directly supports the token
- **Price Impact**: Regular buybacks create buying pressure
- **Transparency**: Every buyback is verifiable on-chain
- **Alignment**: Platform success = token success = community success
