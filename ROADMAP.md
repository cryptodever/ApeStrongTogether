## Buyback System Transparency 🔥

### How It Works
**20% of all paid subscription revenue** automatically goes to meme coin buybacks.

1. **Automatic Allocation**: When you subscribe, 20% of your payment is automatically allocated to buybacks
2. **Scheduled Execution**: Buybacks are executed regularly daily or weekly
3. **Full Transparency**: Public dashboard showing total buybacks executed, buyback history, next scheduled buyback, and token price impact
4. **On Chain Verification**: All buyback transactions are recorded on chain for full transparency

### Why This Matters
- **Community Value**: Your subscription directly supports the token
- **Price Impact**: Regular buybacks create buying pressure
- **Transparency**: Every buyback is verifiable on chain
- **Alignment**: Platform success equals token success equals community success

### Revenue Breakdown
- **80%**: Platform costs, development, and operations
- **20%**: Meme coin buybacks automatic, transparent, on chain
