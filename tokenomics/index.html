        <section class="tokenomics-section card">
            <h2>1️⃣ What Tokenomics Mean For Our Project</h2>
            <p>Tokenomics is simply how our token works — how it's distributed, how it's used, and how it's designed to grow sustainably over time.</p>
            <p>For us, tokenomics aren't about hype or quick gains. They're about building something that lasts. We've structured everything to prioritize:</p>
            <ul class="tokenomics-list">
                <li><strong>Long-term stability</strong> — No sudden dumps or rug pulls. We're here for the long haul.</li>
                <li><strong>Fairness</strong> — Everyone gets a fair shot. No insider advantages or hidden allocations.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency</strong> — Every allocation is public. Every lock is verifiable. No surprises.</li>
                <li><strong>Trust</strong> — By being upfront about everything, we build the kind of trust that creates real communities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We know "dev dump" fears are real in crypto. That's why we've built protections against them. Our goal isn't to make quick cash — it's to build something the community can believe in.</p>

            <h2>9️⃣ Future Growth & Sustainability</h2>
            <p>Our tokenomics are designed to support long-term growth, not short-term pumps. Here's how:</p>
            
            <div class="growth-features">
                <div class="growth-item">
                    <h3>👥 User Growth</h3>
                    <p>Allocations for marketing and partnerships help bring new users into the ecosystem, growing the community organically.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="growth-item">
                    <h3>💎 Long-Term Holders</h3>
                    <p>Staking rewards and utility features incentivize holding rather than quick flipping, building a stable holder base.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="growth-item">
                    <h3>🌱 Ecosystem Expansion</h3>
                    <p>Reserve funds and partnership allocations allow us to expand into new features and integrations over time.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>⚙️ Continuous Utility</h3>
                    <p>As we add features, the token gains more uses, creating ongoing demand and value beyond speculation.</p>

            <div class="sustainability-note">
                <p><strong>Our approach:</strong> We're not promising profits or guaranteed returns. Instead, we're building a structure that supports sustainable growth through real utility, community engagement, and long-term thinking. The tokenomics are designed to reward those who believe in the project and stick around.</p>

            <h2>Transparency. Trust. Long-Term Thinking.</h2>
            <p>That's what our tokenomics are built on. No hype, no empty promises — just a clear structure designed for sustainability and fairness.</p>
            <p>If you have questions about any allocation, lock, or feature, we're here to answer them. Everything is on-chain and verifiable.</p>
